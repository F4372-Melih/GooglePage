# CS50's Web Programming - First assignment

## Objectives

Create three different pages, index page which is the default google search browser, google images page and lastly advanced search page. Use creative tools and css to
resemble the original google pages. 

### What is missing from the project

1. The search icon inside the search bar doesn't do anything yet. 
2. Hovering over the search bar doesn't display any changes
3. Font sizes can be resized
4. The whole advance search page
5. There might be so discrepancy in terms of centering div on the index or images pages. They don't seem to be consistent.



### Current obstacles

In the advance section of the html pages, I have attempted to recreate the original using the inspection method. However
it was too complicated and messed up my tables. Now I will try simpler methods with less div.
